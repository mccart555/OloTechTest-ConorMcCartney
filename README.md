#Intro

For this exercise I have created a single page application using ASP.NET core MVC and JQuery – it’s just a library not a framework.  I was tempted to add in a relational or NoSQL database so that state could be maintained indefinitely, but it would mean that for installation and running you would need to install and run Docker Desktop.  To keep it simple I have decided not to do this as I want it to be easy to run and I thought it might be outside the scope of this exercise.

#Instructions on how to run

1. Open in Visual Studio 2022, then build and run the app.

Please note - I would have added the filers as requested but I have already spent more time than the suggested 90 minutes so I am going to stop.

Thanks for the opportunity.

Conor McCartney.
